# Application CPU Scheduling Simulation
Given three applications, a simulation will run a three sets of process sizes to determine the performance rate of the application using FCFS, SJF, LJF, and Round Robin algorithms.

## Instructions
To compile and run application, enter the following in terminal in order:
1. javac *.java
2. java Main

Choose one of the application programs provided, choose a process set size, and then click on the **simulate button** to obtain the results of that application's overall turnaround time, waiting time, and throughput as well as the averages for each scheduler for the specified process set size. As each scheduler runs asynchronously, please allow between 30 seconds to 2 minutes to pass for the results to appear on the GUI. 

To reset the simulation, click on the **reset button** to clear the application selection and the tables generated.

## Trials
To test a new trial: press the reset button to start a new trial. 
For example: (assuming the user starts with trial one) once you finish that trial (completed simulating all applications for the following process count), please press the **reset button** to start a trial two, and then press the **reset button** to start trial three.

### Trial One 
Process Set Size: 3

### Trial Two
Process Set Size: 6

### Trial Three 
Process Set Size: 10
