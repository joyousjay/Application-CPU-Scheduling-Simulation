# Application CPU Scheduling Simulation
Given three applications, a simulation will run a fixed number of processes to determine the performance rate of the application using FCFS, SJF, LJF, and Round Robin algorithms.

## Instructions
To compile and run application, enter the following in terminal in order:
1. javac *.java
2. java Main

Choose one of the application programs provided and click on the **simulate** button to obtain the results of that application's overall turnaround time, waiting time, and throughput as well as the averages for each scheduler. As each scheduler runs asynchronously, please allow between 30 seconds to 2 minutes to pass for the results to appear on the GUI.

You are able to change the burst times of an application. When an application that has modified burst times is clicked again, it will maintain the previous change to the burst times. To reset the burst times of the application to the default times, exit the GUI window and restart a new one. 

To reset and choose another application, click on the **reset** button to clear the application selection and the tables generated.
