# Application CPU Scheduling Simulation
Given three applications, a simulation will run a three sets of process sizes to determine the performance rate of the application using FCFS, SJF, LJF, and Round Robin algorithms.

## Instructions
To compile and run application, enter the following in terminal in order:
1. javac *.java
2. java Main

Choose one of the application programs provided, choose a process set size, and then click on the simulate button to obtain the results of that application's overall turnaround time, waiting time, and throughput as well as the averages for each scheduler for the specified process set size. As each scheduler runs asynchronously, please allow between 30 seconds to 2 minutes to pass for the results to appear on the GUI.

You can edit the burst times of an application by double clicking on the cell under the burst time column for a specific process. Once you entered the value desired for the burst time, press “Enter” on the computer keyboard or click on another cell on the table to save the change. When an application that has modified burst times is clicked again, it will maintain the previous change to the burst times. To reset the burst times of the application to the default times, exit the GUI window and restart a new one. 

To reset the simulation, click on the reset button to clear the application selection and the tables generated. However, due to the same GUI running, it will save any changes made to the burst times for an application.
