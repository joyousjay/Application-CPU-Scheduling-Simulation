# CPU-Scheduling-Simulation
Given three applications, a simulation will run a fixed number of processes to determine the performance rate of the application using FCFS, SJF, LJF, and Round Robin algorithms.

## Instructions
To compile and run application, enter the following in terminal in order:
- javac Main.java
- java Main

Choose one of the application programs provided and click on the **simulate** button to obtain the results of that application's overall turnaround time, waiting time, and throughput as well as the averages for each scheduler. As each scheduler runs asynchronously please allow between 30 seconds to 1 minute to pass for the results to appear on the GUI.

To reset and choose another application, click on the  **reset** button to clear the application selection and the tables generated.
