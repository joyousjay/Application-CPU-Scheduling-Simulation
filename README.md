# CPU-Scheduling-Simulation
Given three applications, a simulation will run a fixed number of processes to determine the performance rate of the application using FCFS, SJF, LJF, and Round Robin algorithms.

## Instructions
To compile and run application, enter the following in terminal:
> javac Main.java
> java Main

Choose one of the application programs provided and click on the **simulate** button to obtain the results of that application's overall turnaround time, waiting time, and throughput.

To reset and choose another application, click on the  **reset** button to clear the application selection and the tables generated.
